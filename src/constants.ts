      "Growing up I was outside all the time playing with local neighbors and using our environment to fit whatever game we were playing. During those times things like gardening or lawn care were viewed as chores and avoided activities. However, as I reflect back it was a connective tissue to my community and neighbors. I recall meeting one of my closest childhood friends through him offering to help pickup leaves. Now having a home garden and growing vegetables, herbs, and fruits has taught me the health benefits of organic food. With a greater appreciation, understanding for plants and our environment, I'm building WEFA as a way for youth to plant deeper roots and adults to reconnect or better connect with their community and nature.",
    architecture:
      "WEFA aims to make cultivating your environment fun whether it's a single plant in a bedroom or a full garden. Now many will ask how can that be fun. Many have tried and failed or downright find plants and caring for them boring. I'll now ask how many play or have played games like Farmville, Minecraft, Pokemon Go, WoW or others spending countless hours? For those who have or do, WEFA is a platform connecting nature and games with Augmented Reality, Blockchains, and AI to create a symbiotic relationship between the two. Helping individuals and communities find short and long term success in health, social connection and sustainability. I've told my story to WEFA, now below is the plot for the initial comic release of WEFA in correlation with the platform and initial game, think Pokemon meets Avatar: The Last Airbender.",

      "A group of college kids find themselves on an unexpected journey where worlds collide. Taking place in 2042 in a recently industrialized town in Nigeria now a part of a larger country called Wau (wa-ooo), with a newly minted university funded by a multinational corporation known as CoeUp. Known for a rare mineral finding almost 100 years ago and since then pillaging the local lands unknowingly causing an imbalance between two worlds. The most brightest & privileged students from all corners of the world are chosen to attend the university, with a few locals allowed. In an unexpected turn during a class forest exhibition the group gain a set of unique abilities when wandering off into a cave and an earthquake hits. Though all coming from different backgrounds they learn to trust each other, forging a deep connection not only to one another but to this new world and creatures they've found through their abilities. To address the issues caused by CoeUp, the group must lean on nature and community to find a solution and restore balance.",
    learnings:
      "Connecting all the dots, WEFA's comic release will coincide with the app release in 2024. The comic will be a   physical and digital collectible that enables users to redeem creature packs when planting their 1st plants. Story elements from the comic will tie into gameplay creating a cohesive experience between them. This year we will release an alpha and beta version with the alpha set for Summer this year. Goal is to have planted 1,000 in alpha, 10,000 in beta, and 100,000 in 2024 when fully released, adding a zero for the next 5-7 years. Thanks for reading this far, the rest of my portfolio are past works to give a sense of what I've accomplished.",

    architecture:
      "Given the project's aim of giving art/asset ownership the SEC and regulations played a huge role in how the app could function along with the partners needed to meet compliance. The frontend focus was on creating a personal and engaging experience for the user enabling them to view their assets and have DeFi utility to take out liquidity or view them in a fun 3D manner. On the backend was a Node.js api handling authentication of users with SIWE (Sign in with Ethereum) and connecting with external providers to place buy/sell orders on assets.",
    development:
      'When joining this project it was at an early stage with only a blog page built. 1st focus was building authentication which being a web3 app we used email login & SIWE to enable users to use their email without a password alongside crypto wallet. The focus then shifted towards notifications, a profile page and the art gallery which were E2E features starting from the database schema using Prisma and GraphQL. In addition I created smart contracts to enable the liquidity pool feature offered by the app, that enabled user to access asset liquidity for DeFi protocols.',
    learnings:
      'Being a contract role I was able to learn a ton in a short period of time. First developing and deploying contracts to a testnet was great experience in Solidity development and gave me confidence to continue building contracts.

Having full autonomy for certain functionality showed where I can improve as a developer and iterate faster.',

    problem:
      'As one of the core products of Mira we wanted to revamp the video chat platform to enable clients to be more productive while providing a more stable environment to facilitate headset operators in the field. In the previous version of the video platform only two people could be in a call. To enable our clients to more effectively help headset and mobile operators in the field we updated to a multiparty call structure while adding more features such as invites, guest calls, and meeting reports.',
    architecture:
      'The team spent a good amount of time determining how to architect the app, given it was the next major version of a core product. In order to facilitate larger calls using a provider for the turn/stun and media servers was the most optimal path for a good UX. Another key element was revamping the UI to work in a multi-call fashion adopting a UI similar to Google meets with an industrial aesthetic. Lastly communication between clients that were not facilitated by the provider such as annotations, messages, and availability. We initially used polling websockets on the client, who would update their status every few seconds and update a Redis store. During development we switched to a more robust messaging tool with RabbitMQ and MQTT to have message reliability and faster communication.',
    development:
      'Focusing on the web client, initial UI work was done with Storybook to build the components in isolation and quickly iterate upon shifting designs. On the state/data management side I built a new module to interface with our 3rd party provider of webRTC call services using MobX State Tree. In addition I created modules for our internal services such as ringing and joining/leaving a room along with post meeting reports. After the initial alpha release we realized our message transport was unreliable with websockets. We pivoted to integrating a message broker using RabbitMQ which greatly helped reliability. After we continued to integrate new features such as call links and invites exposing meetings to external guests and organizations.',
    learnings:
      'Leading a project as an sole contributor was much simpler than leading a team, in this case contracted developers based in Romania. Having to traverse the time difference and delineate work at times was challenging but overall a rewarding experience. Was also the 1st project where I led the architecture discussions creating initial PRDs for the web, sequence and flow diagrams, and more. This taught me more about network protocols and how they transfer data in different manners along with complex state management. Lastly cross team collaboration from the headset, web and api is not always easy and being transparent when making changes that may effect another is the best way to avoid friction.',

      'Clients doing handsfree workflow with headsets wanted to fully transfer all workflow to the platform. In order to enable that they needed another way to complete workflows that were input heavy and could be held in hand. To facilitate this a tablet companion app was seen as the most ideal way to address the issue. This would be useful for work that was more observation rather than manipulation based and allow those workflows to live on the same platform. In addition to adding another source of revenue for the company.',
    architecture:
      "Given this was a new platform being added to the product it was important to key in on the best tools to use given the team's skill set and urgency to release an MVP. Through discussions React Native was settled upon as the best option enabling the web and unity teams to contribute, with unity being able to write native modules React Native could hook in to. At the business logic level we had to transfer our workflow/compliance logic into Typescript. Within this process some difference between how workflows should function on the headset vs mobile device emerged with tweaks being made to accommodate each platform. The final stack consisted of a Node.js API, React Native client with Swift modules for data queueing/uploading.",
    development:
      'First element to key in on was the workflow logic writing it in Typescript. This was one of the more challenging aspect having no documentation on our logic and only a version written in C#. After transferring logic, the next step was building the UI which consisted of a tab based navigation with tabs to view workflows, recent workflows, and history along with authentication views for individual and team login. The workflow tab was a directory style view where users can click into folders, this was fun to architect and optimize. Once the UI was completed integration with the API started, some routes needed to be updated to add a new platform (mobile) for database and analytical purposes. Lastly to optimize the uploading of workflows which could contain images we built a queue in Swift to offload that process from the single javascript thread improving UI performance.',
    learnings:
      'This was a huge step forward for me in responsibility and leading a project. Along with my 1st time stepping into mobile development which though using React Native still was a different development process and subtle difference in code. Within the code the workflow logic was a fun exercise in building complex logic and conditional flows. One thing I learned to improve was over optimizing too early in a project which actually causes more performance issues, itâ€™s a lot simpler to complete the initial flow and structure then key in on optimization.',

    development:
      ' I joined the team about a week into development with the initial backend being the only work completed. The 1st task was integrating GraphQL with Apollo due to its comprehensive tooling. With the data layer completed I switched focus to the UI creating the home, product detail, and products pages. The home page was mainly a use of flexbox and carousels for product viewing with bold full screen heroes throughout. The products page was a grid layout using flexbox (at the time the css-grid had partial support) and a trailing animation. The product detail page was the more complex with a two column layout with the left being scrollable and right fixed. Lastly was integrating the payment flow with the backend which due to graphQL was pretty seamless.',
    learnings:
      'This was my 1st full time role working in a team, before this point I mainly had done freelance work for clients. Stepping into a team environment was invigorating and gave me a boost in confidence and peers to learn from. Initially I had imposter syndrome having not worked in a professional software environment and it took some time to settle into the role. It helped having a supportive team and manager in traversing the environment. One of the key takeaways is I had more to learn as a developer from advanced methods, data structures, and new languages like Typescript.',
